General algorithmg for the second program

-initialize an accumulator to 0
-Initialize a count variable to 0
-open the input file.
-for each line in the file:
  -convert the line to a floating-point number. (this is the running time for a video.)
  -Add one to the count variable. (This keeps count of the number of videos).
  -display the running time for the video
  -add the running time to the accumulator.
-close the file
Display the contents of the accumulator as the total running time.
